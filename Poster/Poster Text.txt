What is a 'Fading Channel'?

A Rayleigh Fading Channel is a model for a channel
where multiple copies of transmissions reflect 
and refract off the environment before getting 
to the receiver. Each transmission is independently 
phase and amplitude shifted by the channel. At the 
receiver, all the randomly shifted transmissions add
together, making it difficult to decode.

The channel's coeffecients can be estimated using a
'Channel Estimator'. The Channel Estimator used in this 
simulation is built with multiplexed pilot signals.



The Alamouti Scheme

A transmission scheme proposed by S. M. Alamouti in 1998 
allows for the original transmitted data to be determined 
with good accuracy. His original scheme required 2 transmitters
and 1 receiver, but could be extended to multiple receivers. 
The scheme involves sending copies of a transmission in 2 time 
frames, then, using a channel estimator and his combining scheme
at the receiver, the original transmissions can be determined.
